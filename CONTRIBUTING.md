## Making Changes

### Creating a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
# or
git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
```

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - for new features
- `fix/` - for bug fixes
- `docs/` - for documentation changes
- `test/` - for adding or updating tests
- `refactor/` - for code refactoring

### Commit Message Guidelines

Use clear, descriptive commit messages:

```
type(scope): description

# Examples:
feat(gujarati): add support for additional vowel combinations
fix(hindi): resolve issue with nukta character handling
docs(readme): update installation instructions
test(engines): add comprehensive tests for special characters
```

## Testing

### Running Tests

Always run tests before submitting changes:

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode during development
npm run test:watch

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Add tests for new features in the `__tests__/` directory
- Follow existing test patterns and naming conventions
- Ensure good test coverage for new code
- Test both success and error cases

Example test structure:

```typescript
describe('Feature Name', () => {
  let bhaSha: BhaSha;

  beforeEach(() => {
    bhaSha = new BhaSha();
  });

  test('should handle basic case', () => {
    expect(bhaSha.transliterateText('input')).toBe('output');
  });
});
```

## Submitting Changes

### Before Submitting

1. **Sync with upstream**:

   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run the full test suite**:

   ```bash

   ```

3. **Build the project**:

   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

4. **Check code style**:
   ```bash
   npm run lint
   ```

4. Update type definitions
5. Add documentation and examples

### Language Engine Structure

```typescript
export class NewLanguageEngine extends BaseEngine {
  language = 'newlanguage' as const;

  protected getTransliterationMap(): Record<string, string> {
    return {
      // Add transliteration mappings
    };
  }
}
```
